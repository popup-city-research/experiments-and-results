# experiments-and-results
A place to log and keep track of pop-up city experiments and results. Similar to academic research format, so people can build on previous work easily. The goal is to encourage retrospectives / reflections and make learnings / knowledge more accessible across the ecosystem. 

## List of Experiments / Resources
Note: the goal at first is to do an absolute brain dump of everything here and then categorize later. If you know of any experiments / resources / projects that you think is worth adding, please add. Heuristic: If you're unsure if it fits, add anyway (easier to remove vs to add).

### QuarkID
**Experiment TLDR**:  
QuarkID as digital trust framework creating Aleph's passport during the pop up city.  
**Popup city**: Aleph  
**Dates**:  July-August 2024  
**Retro article**:  
QuarkID served as a digital trust framework to manage user access passports during a Pop-up City event in Buenos Aires. The goal was to create a unique and verifiable digital identity for each attendee, ensuring quick and secure access to various spaces and activities throughout the event.  

How did it work?  
Digital Registration: Users created their QuarkID DID (a digital identifier) blockchain-based digital identity. This process replaced the need for physical credentials or traditional documents.   

Access Passport: Through their QuarkID, participants received a digital passport that allowed them to move around the temporary city, gaining access to specific zones and exclusive events by simply scanning a QR code. There w  

Decentralized Verification: Backed by ZK technology, the data was immutable and decentralized. This meant verification happened without intermediaries, preventing fraud and ensuring that each passport belonged to the correct person.  

Q passports: 2400 between holders, startups, sponsors, team and volunteers
