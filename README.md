# experiments-and-results
A place to log and keep track of pop-up city experiments and results. Similar to academic research format, so people can build on previous work easily. The goal is to encourage retrospectives / reflections and make learnings / knowledge more accessible across the ecosystem. 

## List of Experiments / Resources
Note: the goal at first is to do an absolute brain dump of everything here and then categorize later. If you know of any experiments / resources / projects that you think is worth adding, please add. Heuristic: If you're unsure if it fits, add anyway (easier to remove vs to add).
